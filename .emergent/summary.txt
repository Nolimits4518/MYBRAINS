The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines the development of a sophisticated RSI trading bot, evolving from a standalone Python script into a full-fledged web application with a futuristic UI. Initially, the focus was on deploying the existing bot logic, including Binance market data and Telegram alerts. A critical pivot occurred when the user clarified the need for a web-based dashboard using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, rather than a standalone service. Subsequent enhancements included multi-cryptocurrency support (via CoinGecko/Binance, replacing FinViz), multi-timeframe trading, advanced charting, and a stunning cyberpunk UI transformation. The most recent and complex task involves building a Universal Trading Platform Connector for dynamic exchange integration, leveraging web automation (Playwright). The development has been highly iterative, with the AI engineer constantly adapting to user feedback and progressively adding features, testing after each major iteration.

<product_requirements>
The initial product was an RSI trading bot to monitor crypto prices (ETHUSD/BTCUSD), calculate RSI, detect signals, send Telegram alerts, and integrate with PVP.trade. The bot was to run 24/7 with error handling. Key trading logic included RSI buy/sell signals, grid take profits, and stop loss.

The product evolved into a web application with a real-time trading dashboard (FastAPI backend, React frontend, MongoDB).
Subsequent requirements included:
1.  **Comprehensive Crypto Data**: Fetch all cryptocurrencies (initially requested from FinViz, later adapted to CoinGecko and Binance) and enable multi-timeframe selection (1m to 1M).
2.  **Advanced Charting**: Display positions, price P&L, trade size, and other metrics on charts (OHLCV, RSI, signals).
3.  **UI Transformation**: Implement a Cyberpunk-inspired UI with neon accents, holographic elements, 3D effects, and real-time data visualization across a multi-tabbed dashboard (Dashboard, Charts, Position, Analytics).
4.  **Universal Trading Platform Connector**: Enable the bot to connect to *any* trading account by providing a login page URL and credentials, handling dynamic form fields and 2-factor authentication codes from the user.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Real-time Data**: Binance WebSocket for market data, internal WebSockets for UI updates.
-   **Trading Logic**: RSI (Relative Strength Index) calculation, signal detection, grid take-profit, stop-loss.
-   **Asynchronous Programming**: Python  and .
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Three.js (for 3D graphics), Zustand (state management).
-   **Web Automation**: Playwright (for universal platform connector), BeautifulSoup4 (for parsing HTML).
-   **Third-party Integrations**: Telegram Bot API, PVP.trade API (simulated/template), CoinGecko API.

<code_architecture>

Code is organized into a standard full-stack application structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core FastAPI application.
    -   **Summary**: Contains the main application logic, API endpoints for bot control, data retrieval (cryptocurrencies, timeframes), trade execution (simulated PVP.trade), and WebSocket endpoints for real-time frontend updates. It also defines data models (, ) and integrates , , and the  classes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily rewritten multiple times. Initially set up the bot's core logic. Later, adapted to web architecture, integrated CoinGecko and Binance for multi-crypto/timeframe data, added  model, and updated to support the new UI. Most recently, modified to import and integrate the  class and its associated endpoints.
-   **/app/backend/platform_connector.py**: (NEW) This file was recently created.
    -   **Summary**: Designed to encapsulate the logic for the Universal Trading Platform Connector. It will use web automation (Playwright) to interact with external trading platforms, handle login, extract form fields, and manage 2FA.
    -   **Changes Made**: Full creation of this file, likely containing classes and methods for browser automation, page interaction, and credential management.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores environment variables like , , , and .
    -   **Changes Made**:  and  were explicitly added and confirmed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component.
    -   **Summary**: Manages the application's overall state, routing (using react-router-dom), and integrates various components for the dashboard, charts, positions, and analytics. It handles WebSocket connections for real-time data and manages bot control actions (start/stop).
    -   **Changes Made**: Completely rewritten multiple times. Initially set up a basic dashboard. Then adapted to support multi-crypto/timeframe selection and advanced charting. Most recently, transformed into the cyberpunk UI, and currently being updated to integrate the  component.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: Global CSS styles.
    -   **Summary**: Contains the primary styling for the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Completely rewritten for the Cyberpunk-inspired UI, incorporating neon colors, holographic effects, glitch animations, and particle backgrounds using Tailwind CSS.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/PlatformConnector.js**: (NEW) This file was recently created.
    -   **Summary**: This component is intended to provide the user interface for configuring and interacting with the Universal Trading Platform Connector. It will likely include fields for platform URLs, credentials, and a mechanism to input 2FA codes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Full creation of this file.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt** and **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Summary**: List Python and Node.js dependencies, respectively.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated to include new libraries such as , , , , usage: websockets [--version | <uri>], , ,  (backend) and , , , , , , , etc. (frontend).

<pending_tasks>
-   **PVP.trade API Integration**: The bot still uses simulated trading for PVP.trade; real integration is pending once credentials are provided and the universal connector is finalized.
-   **Risk Management Enhancements**: Max daily loss limits, position size based on account balance, and Telegram kill switch functionality are proposed but not implemented.
-   **Production Enhancements**: Database logging for trade history, performance monitoring, alerts, and automatic backups are planned but not yet implemented.
-   **Backtesting**: Running comprehensive backtests on historical data remains a future task.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on implementing the **Universal Trading Platform Connector**. This ambitious feature aims to allow the bot to connect to *any* trading account given its login page URL and credentials, handling dynamic form fields and two-factor authentication.

**Key steps taken for this work:**
1.  **Backend Dependencies**: Installed necessary Python libraries (, , , ) in .
2.  **Frontend Dependencies**: Installed React-related libraries (, , etc.) in .
3.  **New Backend Module**: Created  to house the web automation logic for connecting to external platforms.
4.  **Backend Integration**: Modified  to integrate the newly created , updating API endpoints to leverage the universal connector's capabilities.
5.  **New Frontend Component**: Created , which will serve as the UI for managing platform connections.

The current state is that the  and  have been updated, and the  component has been created. The next immediate step is to integrate this new React component into the main  to make it accessible in the UI.
